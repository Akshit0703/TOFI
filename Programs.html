        <h1>YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
               It aims to bring out the leadership qualities of the YOUTH.
            </p>
            <P>
                The managerical positions are filled on the basis of merit. Involvement in decision making is priortised as "leadership can only be effective when there is participation."
            </P>
            <p>They experience the cultural and universal diversity through youth forums , city chapters, clusters, state and national conferences</p>
            <p>
                Currently there are four projects that require youth's attention and solutions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>Food and Shelter</li>
                    <li>Sustainable Development and Environment Issues</li>
                    <li>Illegal and Gender bias Issues</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
               "YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM" exists for the youth to act in unison with an aim to create an impact by addressing social, political, and environmental issues. It makes them realize significance of a <strong>youth led nation</strong> .

        <h1>REACH TO TEACH PROGRAM</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                "REACH TO TEACH" program is one of its kind because by being deployed in government schools the youth acquire the values of kindness and hard work by teaching it to students.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>"When one teaches two learn" by Robert Hienlein</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The program aims to provide the studnets with soft skills along with practical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
             "THINK OF IT " aims to gather the youth to put their efforts toward something that can make a long lasting impact for the unfortunate citizens of this country and we implore the well-aware authorities to direct funds towards this cause.   
            </p>
            <p>
                The youth will impart soft skills to children in order to meet the employment requirements amidst the ever-growing competition wherein mere degress and diplomas are worthless without practical knowledge.          
            </p>
            <p>
                With collective aid and funds we intend to wipe out this problem and create a safe future for all children coming from unfortunate backrounds.<strong>If they are deprived of oppurtunities today, we might be deprived of a better future tomorrow.</strong>
